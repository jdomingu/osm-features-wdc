# OpenStreetMap Features WDC
A Tableau Web Data Connector (WDC) to get data about OpenStreetMap features in an area that you select.

[Hosted version here](http://jdomingu.github.io/osm-features-wdc/)

This WDC uses the [Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) to query OpenStreetMap data. Note that it only makes available a small number of the possible map features as defined by OpenStreetMap. For a full reference of map features, see the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features). 

Feel free to fork and extend this connector to add the map features that you're interested in!
